Office Nomads is Seattle’s oldest coworking space and a fixture in the iconic
Capitol Hill neighborhood.   Established in 2007, Jacob and his business partner
Susan Evans Dorsch created a strong community of dedicated entrepreneurs,
freelancers and remote workers.  They were quick to realize that the value of
their space isn’t desks or fast wifi, it is the relationships with the people in
the space.  Over the years, Office Nomads has been a leader in the coworking
movement.  Jacob and Susan established the Seattle Coworking Alliance, a
collaborative group for people who run spaces. Jacob has been the keynote
speaker at international coworking conferences and founded Open Coworking,
a non-profit project based organization to support the global coworking movement.
Office Nomads runs on Nadine, the open source coworking software platform
developed by Jacob.
