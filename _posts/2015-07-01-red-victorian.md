Jessy Kate Schingler and the Embassy Network, a new model for urban coliving, had just taken over a 1904 Victorian hotel and commercial space. The previous owner, Sami Sunchild fully embraced the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and maintained the 1968 aesthetic. Jessy Kate needed to simultaneously maintain the relationship with the existing community and update the design and the business model.
