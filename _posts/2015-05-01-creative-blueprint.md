Creative Blueprint is an artists’ community started in Toronto.  Ashley Proctor, the founder of Creative Blueprint, wanted to build a coworking and artists’ studio space in a former gym. She had a limited budget and the intention of keeping overhead low to keep the space affordable for artists in the increasingly unaffordable Capitol Hill District of Seattle.
